## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Cosmolet:

- **DO NOT create a public GitHub issue.**
- **DO NOT share details publicly until the vulnerability has been resolved.**

Instead, please report it confidentially to the Cosmolet security team at:

`security@platformbuilds.org`  

Please provide as much detail as possible including:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept (if possible).
- Your contact information for any follow-up.

The security team will acknowledge your report within 3 business days and coordinate with you privately on remediation, patch releases, and coordinated disclosure where necessary.

## Security Practices

- We review code for potential security issues during code review and before new releases.
- Dependencies are monitored regularly for upstream vulnerabilities (using tools such as GitHub Dependabot).
- We encourage responsible disclosure and strive for transparency after a vulnerability is resolved.

## Public Disclosure

Once a vulnerability is fixed:
- We will publish security advisories in the Cosmolet GitHub repository and project website, crediting reporters upon request.
- Users are advised to upgrade immediately to the patched version.
